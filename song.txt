Too high, too deep
It's you, it's me
Too wired to sleep, oh, yeah
One thing to need
Three words, I speak
When you're with me, babe

Oh, come on, come on
However I act, you know how much I care
Come on, come on
You know what I want, now meet me if you dare
Love on the run, love on the run, run
Do anything to be there, be there
